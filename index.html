        <p>"Bake4Humanity" is an annual summer fundraiser that creates a variety of baked goods, then donates all profits to those in need. Each item is accompanied by a relevant charity (ex. "Puppy Cakes" for the Franklin Township  Animal Shelter). Although, these baked goodies come with a twist - you can opt to have them delivered by a robot! Since "Bake4Humanity" is exclusively offered to Timberponds residents, either one of our biking employees or an autonomous robot can deliver your purchase, simply select your preference upon purchase.

Whether it be from apple pies to red velvet cupcakes, I have never exhausted my supply of eager buyers.  However, this year I came to a shocking realization. This realization was shocking not because it was unobvious, but because I had not come to it earlier. I had been doing nothing with the proceeds I had received from my baked goods, that is, nothing beneficial to my community. That's when I came up with "Bake4Humanity". This annual fundraiser encourages me to give back to my community, and for you to give back to yours. With every bite comes a smile!
